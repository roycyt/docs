# Default values
When a function is created with a default value, that same object
is used in every function call where the default value is not overridden.
Unless this shared state is desired, itâ€™s better to use immutable state for default values, or a unique object to serve as an identity check.
# Explicitly positional/key-value
A function signature containing `/` specifies that the arguments to the left in the function signature are positional only. `*` conversely specifies that arguments to the right in the function signature are keyword only. Arguments between the two can be called in either
manner.

def greet(name, /, title, *, punctuation):
