- Referencing a given data structure is done by assigning our data structures to variables using the assignment operator, `=`.
-  Variables are **references** to values, like data structures, and the type of the variable is determined by the type of the value that is assigned to the
variable.
- Variables do not have a set data type; they are simply a **name** that refers to a value. The data type of a variable is determined by the type of the value that is currently assigned to the variable.
- In Python, variables are references to objects, which means that when you create a variable and assign a value to it, the variable does not store the value directly, it instead stores a reference to the object that contains the value.
